      "taskTitle": "Event CRUD Operations",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Event CRUD Operations task into 5 subtasks, focusing on separating the backend API implementation, database operations, frontend form components, event display integration, and testing strategy. For each subtask, provide a clear title, description, dependencies, and detailed implementation steps.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both backend and frontend work with multiple API endpoints and UI components. It requires database integration, form validation, and connecting components to the API. The task already has 4 subtasks but could benefit from further breakdown of testing and validation aspects."

      "taskTitle": "Appointment Creation Modal Interface",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Appointment Creation Modal Interface task into 4 subtasks, focusing on modal component structure, form field implementation with validation, integration with the event API, and accessibility/responsive design considerations. For each subtask, provide a clear title, description, dependencies, and detailed implementation steps.",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on a specific UI component with form fields, validation, and API integration. It has moderate complexity due to the various form fields (date/time pickers, color selection) and validation requirements. The current 3 subtasks cover the basics but adding one for accessibility/responsive design would be beneficial."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Group Management Functionality task into 4 subtasks, focusing on group CRUD API implementation, group management UI components, integration with the event system, and group permission management. For each subtask, provide a clear title, description, dependencies, and detailed implementation steps.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing a complete feature set for group management with both backend and frontend components. It involves database operations, UI components, and integration with the existing event system. The current 3 subtasks are good but adding one for permission management would make it more comprehensive."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Shareable Calendar Links Implementation task into 6 subtasks, focusing on secure token generation, database schema design, permission control system, password protection feature, link expiry functionality, and public calendar view implementation. For each subtask, provide a clear title, description, dependencies, and detailed implementation steps.",
      "reasoning": "This is a complex security-critical feature involving token generation, permission management, and public access to otherwise authenticated content. It requires careful implementation of security features like password protection and expiry dates. The 6 subtasks already defined are comprehensive and well-structured."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Overlapping Events Display Implementation task into 4 subtasks, focusing on event overlap detection algorithm, visual rendering system for overlapping events, color differentiation implementation, and performance optimization for large event sets. For each subtask, provide a clear title, description, dependencies, and detailed implementation steps.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex UI rendering logic and algorithmic challenges to detect and display overlapping events. It requires careful consideration of performance implications and visual design. The 4 existing subtasks are well-defined and cover the necessary aspects of the implementation."

      "taskTitle": "User Profile and Preferences Management",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the User Profile and Preferences Management task into 4 subtasks, focusing on database schema design, preference UI components, application-wide preference application, and timezone/localization implementation. For each subtask, provide a clear title, description, dependencies, and detailed implementation steps.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating user preference storage and UI components with moderate complexity. It requires database work, UI components, and ensuring preferences are applied consistently across the application. Adding a fourth subtask for timezone/localization would enhance the current 3 subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Application Deployment and Infrastructure Setup",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Application Deployment and Infrastructure Setup task into 4 subtasks, focusing on Supabase production environment setup, environment variable management, Vercel configuration and deployment, and post-deployment monitoring and maintenance. For each subtask, provide a clear title, description, dependencies, and detailed implementation steps.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up production infrastructure with Supabase and Vercel. While not algorithmically complex, it requires careful configuration of multiple services and security considerations. The 4 existing subtasks appropriately cover the main aspects of deployment."

      "taskTitle": "Dashboard Enhancement and Dynamic Calendar View Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Dashboard Enhancement and Dynamic Calendar View Implementation task into 5 subtasks, focusing on dashboard metrics implementation, calendar list component, dynamic routing setup, calendar-specific event management, and data relationship implementation. For each subtask, provide a clear title, description, dependencies, and detailed implementation steps.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines dashboard enhancements with dynamic routing implementation, requiring both UI work and backend data relationship management. It has significant complexity due to the need to establish proper data relationships between calendars and events. Currently it has no subtasks, so creating 5 would provide good structure."
